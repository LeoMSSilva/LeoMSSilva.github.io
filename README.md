# :house: About

This project contains my online resume.

To style the **css** and give behavior to the page elements, I used **bootstrap** together with **sass**.

I used **node** to manage dependencies, **gulp** to automate the build process, and **travis** as a ci tool to automate the deploy.

# :dart: Installation

**First you need to install:**

- [Node.js](https://pt-br.nodejs.org) (required)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (required)

  **Then in order, clone the project.**

By HTTPS, running this command:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/LeoMSSilva/LeoMSSilva.github.io.git
```

Or by ssh, running this command:

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:LeoMSSilva/LeoMSSilva.github.io.git
```

SSH is a secure protocol, but you need to register a key ssh in your github before.
